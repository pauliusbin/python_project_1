# Who Wants to be a Millionaire

If you want to became a millionaire you need to answer fifteen questions in 30 minutes. The safety nets are set to 1,000 and 32,000 respectively, with the payout structure being as follows:

    For the first group of five questions: £100, £200, £300, £500, £1,000
    For the second group of five questions: £2,000, £4,000, £8,000, £16,000, £32,000
    For the final group of five questions: £64,000, £125,000, £250,000, £500,000, £1,000,000

During a game you have 2 lifelines:
    50:50: the game's computer eliminates two wrong answers from the current question, leaving behind the correct answer and one incorrect answer.
    Web search: you can search for correct answer in a web (time does not stop)
